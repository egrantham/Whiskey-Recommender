High country only available in Utah? Haven’t seen it before
Abomination - The Crying of the Puma
I don’t even know how the hell to classify these. They’re whiskies by broad definition out of a Californian distillery called Lost Spirits Distillery known for distilling rums and malts but these two whiskies were not distilled there they were distilled on Islay in Scotland. But that’s the less confusing part. The real kicker comes with the maturation.These were traditionally aged in oak for 12-18 months and then unconventionally matured for a further week. A week you say?! That’s not a usual time frame when talking about whisky maturation. Lost Spirits have this thingamajig called a Reactor. It basically matures spirits in the frame of about a week to a point that would take about 15 years using traditional casking. Hence the name. Flavour is then added using oak staves.They have a really impressive website set up explaining their technology with links to white papers on the topic if you really want to geek out (https://www.lostspiritstech.net/home).I was really curious when I heard about these and when one of the guys in my whisky club managed to arrange a bottle share I was in. They’re both made from the same base spirit and “matured” with staves of American oak seasoned with late harvest Reisling but for one “The Crying of the Puma”  they used heavily toasted staves and the other “The Sayers of the Law” they used heavily charred staves. There’s quite a bit of info online about the differences charring and toasting levels of wood have on flavour but the briefest summary would be toasting tends to create more spicey light flavours and charring makes sweeter darker flavours.Abomination – The Crying of the PumaAged 7 days. 54% ABV.

Abraham Bowman Vanilla Bean
Blind sample tasting courtesy of/u/mountaindram thank you! Per the usual the sample was tasted blind initially with notes in italics added during the second (revealed) tasting if I found anything important.Abraham Bowman Vanilla Bean Infused Bourbon – 45%Setup -Neat Glencairn rested 20 minColor -Pecan.Nose -Smells like a bourbon – a touch of oak and char/tannins. A second layer of dried figs and rum cake makes it nice.Takes a minute to dig up the same notes on the second tasting but they are there.Palate -Light body mild warmth. Sweet and savory profile with some oak and honey followed by some vanilla and raisins.Almost like a yogurt-covered raisin flavor. The tannins are just a little out of balance but not bad.Finish -Soft with the vanilla and raisins hanging on throughout the finish.Score -84/100(55 = wft 65 = ugh 75 = OK 85 = good 95 = GREAT!)Value -3/5 @ $60 retail or 2/5 @ $150 secondary for 750ml (5 = must buy; 4 = good buy; 3 = priced right; 2 = overpriced; 1 = avoid).I’m totally guessing on the prices – correct me if I’m wrong. Some nice flavors are there but it just doesn’t wow me. I think it’s a lower proof which also diminishes the score. The vanilla does build up after a bit lingering on the palate for a while but it’s lacking the heartiness I really crave out of a good bourbon. I hate to sound like a broken record but a higher proof would probably do this one good. Or maybe less time on the infusion. Fun dram and a cool experiment makes me want to try the coffee finish!
A. Smith Bowman is a distillery out of Virginia owned by the Sazerac Company.  From what I've read the Buffalo Trace distillery ships tankers of their low rye white dog to Bowman who then redistill it two more times. I imagine most of that product ends up in their John Bowman Small Batch and Single Barrel bourbons the latter of which I think is pretty good.  A few times a year Bowman will also put out some sort of limited edition under the Abraham Bowman line that in years past saw national distribution but these days is more often restricted to Virginia and nearby markets. Here today we have one such Abraham Bowman release from back in 2014 that is a bourbon infused with chopped Madagascar vanilla beans for 24 months. According to a press release it spent a total of 7 years aging in a barrel.Review #182: Abraham Bowman Vanilla Bean Flavored WhiskeyNo Age Statement; 45% ABV; Distilled 4-16-07 Bottled 11-03-14; $70 (2014)Nose:Very subtle soft and thin. As expected vanilla is very predominate and is masking most other typical wood spice or corn notes.Taste:It tastes a little more like bourbon than the nose but the vanilla notes are even more forward now. There is a little woodiness and the proof is finally coming through with some heat but it's really hard to get past all the sweets. It tastes like 90 proof vanilla extract.Thoughts:It's not really offensive but too soft thin and way too sweet for me to get into it. I can't quite get my head around who thought this was a good idea. Vanilla is already such a strong component of Bourbon so why would you infuse it with more? This isn't the worst Abraham Bowman I've ever had (the gingerbread beer wears that crown) but it's certainly near the bottom.Rating: D+Note that price is not considered when assigning a rating.

American Snipe Bottled-In-Bond
American Snipe WhiskeyBottled in bond (50% ABV). I haven’t seen any reviews of this one in quite awhile. To be fair I’ve had this bottle for over two years and I guess it was some kind of one-off release as it seemed to quickly vanish from the shelves.25ml neat in a Glencairn rested 20 minutes.Nose: lots of caramel vanilla honeyPalate: vanilla heavy honey notes and lucky charms marshmallows perhaps? Mellow pleasant at this ABV. Very drinkable.Finish: long sweet and oaky on its way outYum. Far from mind blowing but I will continue to savor this bottle as long as I can. 86/100Have you had this dram? I’d love to know your thoughts!
